component study:
I created a separate module for the phone feature.
from the index I included both the module and the component.
the module is based of the root angular object
the component uses a templateURL and it injects the $http service
the $http service is pulling straight json data from a file.
the template view introduces filters for searching and sorting.
the sort and search parameters are defined by ng-models  with the prefix $ctrl.
the filters are applied inline with the ng-repeat data loop
